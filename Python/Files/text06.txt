OpenAI is testing an A.I.-powered search engine that can access information from across 
the internet in real time.
The prominent A.I. start-up revealed the new prototype, SearchGPT, in a blog post on 
Thursday. The company said it was testing the technology with a small group of users as 
well as online publishers that teamed up with OpenAI to help build the search engine.
“Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts 
to get relevant results,” the company said in its blog post. “We believe that by enhancing
the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, 
finding what you’re looking for can be faster and easier."
OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.
Other companies, including tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as start-ups 
like the San Francisco-based Perplexity, have built similar technologies. These services
augment traditional internet search engines with chatbot technology that generates text 
as a way of answering questions and summarizing online information.
